- Title: This Openclaw Trick Makes Single Agents Obsolete

## Transcript
Most people using OpenClaw are doing it
wrong. They have one agent trying to do
everything, write code, check emails,
manage files, review poll requests, and
they're wondering why it keeps losing
context and going off the rails. But
what if instead of one overloaded agent,
you had a team of specialists, each one
laser focused on a single job,
coordinated under one roof? That's
exactly what a multi- aent system lets
you do in OpenClaw. And in this video,
I'm going to show you two ways to set
them up. Before we get into the how,
let's talk about why you'd want multiple
agents in the first place. Because if
one agent works fine, why complicate
things? Here's the problem. Every agent
has a limited context window. That's how
much information it can hold in its
brain at once. When you give one agent
responsibility for everything, your
codebase, your email integrations, your
documentation, your deployment scripts,
it starts drowning in information. It
forgets instructions. It hallucinates.
It makes mistakes it wouldn't make if it
had a narrower focus. Think of it like
this. Would you rather hire one person
to be your developer, your accountant,
your customer support rep, and your
marketing manager, or would you rather
hire four specialists? Problem two is
prompt pollution. So, when your single
agent system prompt tries to cover 10
different jobs, the instructions start
conflicting. Your be concise instruction
for email drafting fights with your be
thorough instruction for code review.
the agent gets confused about which
personality to use and when. The third
problem is there's no parallelism. A
single agent can only do one thing at a
time. With multiple agents, you can have
one reviewing code while another is
drafting documentation while a third is
scanning your inbox. They work
simultaneously. The fourth problem is
blast radius. If your single agent
breaks or gets confused midtask,
everything stops with multiple agents.
If your email agent has an issue, your
coding agent can keep working. You've
isolated the failure. Now, let me show
you how to actually set this up. There
are two methods, and they serve
different purposes. Option one is what I
call the route method. You set up
routing commands inside your agents.mmd
file to keep sub agent prompts organized
in folders inside your project. This is
great when your sub agents all work
within the same project or codebase.
Option two is the terminal method. You
use the openclaw agents add command to
spin up a sub agent with a completely
separate workspace. This is better when
you need agents that are truly
independent. Different files, different
tools, different context. Let me walk
you through both. Option one is the
route method, and it's the simplest way
to get started with multi- aent setups.
Here's how it works. Step one, create
your sub aent folder inside your
workspace and create a project directory
if you don't have one already, and then
create a new folder for each sub aent.
The folder name should describe what the
agent does. So, if you want an agent
that checks email, you'd create a folder
called check email. Step two is to write
the sub aent prompt. Inside that folder,
create a markdown file that serves as
the agent's instructions. So, inside the
check email folder, you'd create a check
email.md. And this file is basically
that agent's entire personality and
instruction set. So, here's a simple
example. Check email agent. You are an
email management specialist. Your job is
to connect to the user's email inbox.
Scan for unread messages. Summarize the
top five most important emails. Flag
anything that needs urgent intention.
And then we can give it rules. So never
send emails without explicit
confirmation. Always prioritize emails
from context in the VIP list and keep
summaries under two sentences each.
Notice how focused this is. This agent
doesn't know anything about your
codebase, your deployment pipeline or
anything else. It only knows email.
That's the power of specialization. Step
three is to set up the route command in
agents.md.
So go to your main agents.mmd file. This
is your root level agent configuration.
And you're going to add a route command
that tells openclaw when I say this
phrase spin up a sub aent. So add
something like when I type route task,
you will find that task in the projects
folder and spin up a sub aent and pass
that task file as its system prompt. So
now when you type route check email in
your open claw session, it knows to load
the instructions from that sub agent
file and switch context. The agent
becomes the email specialist. You can
set up as many routes as you want. Route
check email, route code review, route
write docs, route deploy, and so on. And
just like that, you've got a team. Your
project folder becomes this organized
hub of specialists and you can switch
between them with a single command. So
when should you use this method? This is
ideal when all your agents work within
the same project context. They share the
same files, the same repository, the
same general environment. You're
basically creating specialized modes for
your main agent. But what if you need an
agent that lives in a completely
different world? Option two is the
terminal method, and this is the one
most people might not know about.
Instead of keeping sub agents inside
your project, you can use OpenClaw's
built-in command to create a sub aent
with its own completely separate
workspace, different directory,
different files, different context,
fully isolated. And here's how. Step
one, run the command in your terminal.
Type openclaw agents add and then your
agent name. So if you want to add a
research agent, you type openclaw agents
add research- agent. You then need to
fill out onboarding for that agent and
OpenClaw creates the agent, sets up a
new workspace for it and registers it in
your agent roster. Step two is to
configure the new agent. Once the agent
is created, you can navigate to its
workspace and set it up however you
want. It has its own prompt file, its
own working directory, its own set of
tools. It's a blank slate. This is where
it gets powerful because this agent
isn't constrained by your main project
at all. You can point it to a different
codebase, set up different security
permissions, give it tools your main
agent might not have. So, for example,
maybe you have your main coding agent
working in your app repository, a
research agent that has web access and
can browse documentation, a data agent
that connects to your analytics
database, a DevOps agent that manages
your cloud infrastructure. Each one
lives in its own workspace. No
crosscontamination, no context
confusion. So, then moving to step
three, managing your agents. You can
list all your agents, switch between
them, or remove ones you don't need
anymore. The terminal gives you full
control over your agent roster. So, when
to use this method? Use option two when
you need true separation. When agents
need different tools, different file
access, different security levels, or
when they're working on entirely
different projects. This is your
enterprisegrade setup. Think of option
one as departments in the same office,
and option two as separate offices in
different buildings. Both are valid. It
depends on how much isolation you need.
Method should you pick? My
recommendation is to start with option
one. Set up two to three routebased sub
aents inside your main project. Get
comfortable with the workflow. Then when
you hit limits when you need an agent
that truly needs its own workspace,
graduate to option two. And honestly,
most advanced setups use both. You'll
have route-based agents for quick
switching within a project and
terminalbased agents for the isolated
workloads. And now you know more about
