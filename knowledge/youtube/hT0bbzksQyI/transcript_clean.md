New OpenClaw update is insane. Open claw
2026.3.11.
Open claw just dropped an update so big
I had to stop everything and cover it
today.
Free AI models 1 million context window
GPT stops cutting itself off mid-thought
better memory. Go support tighter
security and it is all live right now.
This is the update that changes how
serious builders use AI. Let's get into
it. Now, let's break this whole update
down piece by piece because there is a
lot here and every single part matters
if you're building with AI agents right
now. So, first, what is OpenClaw and why
should you care about this update?
OpenClaw is an open-source self-hosted
AI agent gateway. Think of it as a
central hub that connects all your AI
agents together. It sits in the middle
of your stack. It manages how your
agents talk to each other, routes their
actions, and keeps your data secure on
your own infrastructure. Hey, if we
haven't met already, I'm the digital
avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO
agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's
helping clients get more leads and
customers, I'm here to help you get the
latest AI updates. Julian Goldie reads
every comment, so make sure you comment
below. Because it's self-hosted, your
business data never leaves your own
environment. You are not sending
sensitive client information, internal
documents, or anything private to some
third party cloud. You own the whole
thing. You control it. that matters a
lot when you're running a real business.
Now, version 2026.311
just dropped and there are five major
updates in this release. Let me take you
through each one and show you exactly
why it's a big deal. Update number one,
Hunter and Healer alpha free 1 million
context models via Open Router. This is
the headline feature. Openclaw has
introduced two brand new models in alpha
called Hunter and Heila. Both are
available through open router right now
and both support up to 1 million tokens
of context. 1 million tokens. To put
that in perspective, most standard
models work with somewhere between 4,000
and 128,000 tokens. 1 million means you
can load an entire knowledge base, a
complete conversation history, or a
massive document library into a single
prompt. And the model processes all of
it at the same time. Before I keep
going, if you want to go deeper on how
to build AI automation systems like what
boardroom is the place to be. We cover
exactly how to set up agent pipelines,
use tools like OpenClaw, and automate
the parts of your business that are
eating your time. Is the best place to
scale your business, get more customers,
and save hundreds of hours with AI
automation. Link is in the comment and
description. Think about what that means
piece of content, every post, every
module, every piece of member feedback
ever written and feed the whole thing to
the model in one shot. Then you ask it
to find patterns in what members
struggle with most. Identify the highest
performing topics and draft a full
content plan for the next 90 days. All
in one pass. No chunking, no summarizing
first, no losing context halfway
through. Hunter is the model built for
deep research and information retrieval
tasks. Healer is tuned for synthesis and
problem solving. They are designed to
work together inside your OpenCore agent
pipelines and right now during alpha
both are free via open router. That is a
massive advantage if you want to test
large context AI workflows without
paying per token on every run. Stay with
me because the next update builds
directly on top of this. Update number
two, GPT 5.4 stops stopping midthought.
If you have used GPT inside an agent
workflow, you've probably seen this
happen. The model just stops midsentence
mid task. it cuts off and returns an
incomplete response and your whole
pipeline breaks. GPT 5.4 inside OpenClaw
2026 3.11 addresses this directly with
output continuation handling. When the
model hits its generation limit mid
response, OpenClaw now automatically
detects the cutoff, sends a continuation
request and stitches the full output
together before passing it downstream.
Your agents receive complete responses.
your pipelines stop breaking because of
truncated outputs. For anything that
involves long- form generation, detailed
reasoning, or multi-step writing tasks,
this is a serious quality of life
improvement. Imagine running an agent
that drafts detailed SEO content for the
Before this fix, you would sometimes get
half a draft and have to manually handle
the rest. Now, it runs clean all the way
through. Fewer failures, less
babysitting, more reliable output.
Update number three, Gemini embedding 2
for memory. This one is about how your
agents remember things. Open claw now
supports Gemini embedding 2 as the
default embedding model for its memory
layer. Embeddings are how AI systems
convert information into a format they
can search and retrieve later. Better
embeddings mean the system finds more
relevant memories when an agent needs to
look something up. Gemini embedding 2
produces higher quality vector
representations than the previous
default. In practical terms, your agents
retrieve more accurate context when they
search their memory stores. They pull
the right information at the right
moment instead of surfacing something
loosely related. Here's what that looks
like in practice. If you're running a
boardroom that answers member questions,
that agent needs to pull the right
answer from a large bank of SP, past
responses, and training materials. With
better embeddings, it finds the exact
relevant piece instead of something that
kind of matches. The answers get more
precise. Members get better support
without you or your team having to step
in as often. Better memory means smarter
agents. This upgrade makes a real
difference at scale. Update number four,
Open Code Go support. Open Claw's
built-in coding agent, Open Code, now
supports Go as a language. Go is fast,
lightweight, and widely used for
building backend systems, APIs, and
infrastructure tooling. A lot of the
teams building serious AI pipelines are
working in Go. With Go support added to
open code, you can now use the coding
agent to generate, review and iterate on
Go code directly inside your openclaw
environment. If you are building custom
integrations, backend scripts or
automation tools for your business in
Go, this opens up a new category of
tasks you can hand off to the agent. You
describe what you want built Open Code
writes it and you iterate without
leaving the platform. It is a smaller
update compared to the others in this
release, but for developers working in
Go, it removes a real friction point.
Update number five, security hardening
sprint. OpenClaw ran a full security
hardening sprint for this release.
Without going into specific
vulnerability details for obvious
reasons, the team patched several areas
across authentication, API token
handling, and inter agent communication.
They also introduced tighter permission
scoping, which means you can now define
more granular access controls for which
agents can do what inside your
environment. For anyone running OpenCore
in a production environment with real
business data, this is the most
important update in the list.
Self-hosted does not automatically mean
secure. You still need the platform
you're running to be hardened properly.
The fact that the team dedicated an
entire sprint to security in this
release tells you they are taking it
seriously. Before you upgrade, read the
full security change log in the release
notes. There are a couple of breaking
changes in the authentication layer you
will want to know about before you push
this to production. Let me give you the
quick summary of everything in this
release. Hunter and Heila are free 1
million context models in alpha via open
router. Use them now while they're free
and build your large context workflows
before everyone else catches on.
GPT 5.4 stops cutting off mid response
inside OpenClaw. Your long- form agent
tasks now run clean. Gemini embedding 2
improves memory retrieval. Your agents
pull the right information more
accurately. Open code now supports Go.
Developers building in Go can use the
coding agent for their back-end work.
And the security hardening sprint
patches multiple vulnerabilities and
adds granular permission controls. Read
the change log before you upgrade to
production. Now, here's what I want you
to think about. Every single one of
these updates points in the same
direction. AI agents are getting more
capable, more reliable, and more secure.
The gap between businesses that are
building with this technology right now
and businesses that are not is growing
every single month. The 1 million
context window alone is a category
shift. The workflows you can build with
that amount of context available were
not possible 6 months ago. They are
possible today and they are free to test
right now. If you want to be the
business that's ahead of that curve
instead of catching up to it, you need
to be building now. Now, if you want the
